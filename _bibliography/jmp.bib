  abstract = {Tax audits are essential for governments to raise revenue, but can create economic distortions. To avoid the financial burden of an audit, firms could remain small, move to the informal sector, or shutdown. Leveraging detailed administrative tax data from the Ugandan Revenue Authority, a novel linked survey, and a regression discontinuity, we show that audits have two negative effects in our context: they reduce the tax revenue collected among audited firms, \textit{and} impose large economic distortions. Audited firms are 11 percentage point more likely to shutdown, and those that remain operational are induced to reduce their output. The shutdown results are driven by firms who have to pay back substantial amounts of taxes. The output results are driven by firms who believe they are likely to be audited again soon. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that comprehensive audits lead to a revenue loss of 3.6 million USD and, to a first order, an aggregate output loss of 10.9 million USD. Overall, our results demonstrate that comprehensive audits impose large costs on audited firms in our context and ultimately hurt both revenue collection efforts and the real economy.},

Hi! I am a third year PhD student in economics at UCLA, and a student affiliate at CCPR. My studies are supported by Norges Bank's PhD scholarship program.

In my research I study various topics in development and public economics.

I received my bachelor in Economics, Politics and International Studies at [Warwick University](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/), and had the privilege to complete my high school at [UWCAd](https://www.uwcad.it/).
